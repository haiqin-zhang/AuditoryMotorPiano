Code for generating the figures in the article **Auditory-motor surprisal reveals learning across multiple timescales during exploration and production.**
Preprint link: TBD.

The scripts used to produce the figures are located in ARTICLE_FIGS. Each script lists the figures it generates at the top of the file.
A copy of the conda environment used for the analyses is provided in requirements.yml.

**Note:** EEG data is not included in this repository. The .fif files for ERPs must be placed in the expected directories for the scripts to run. The code primarily uses epoch and ERP data, but the preprocessing pipeline is included for reference.

All other folders contain supporting materials and intermediate analyses used to generate the data plotted in the figures.
