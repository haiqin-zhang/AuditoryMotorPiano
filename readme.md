Code for generating figures in the article **Auditory-motor surprisal reveals learning across multiple timescales during exploration and production**.
Preprint link: TBD


The code to make figures is in `ARTICLE_FIGS`. Other folders contain supporting materials. The figures produced by each file are listed at the top of the file.
A copy of the conda environment is in `requirements.yml`.

NOTE: the EEG data is not in this repository. The .fif files for ERPs must be in their respective directories to run the code. The code mostly works off of epoch and ERP data but the preprocessing pipeline is also included for reference.
